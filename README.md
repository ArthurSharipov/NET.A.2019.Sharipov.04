# Day-4
Tasks:
1. Develop a class that allows you to perform the calculation of GCD according to the algorithm
Euclidean for two, three, etc. integers
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm, https://habrahabr.ru/post/205106/,
https://habrahabr.ru/post/205106/). Class methods in addition to computing GCD
must determine the value of time required to perform the calculation.
Add to the developed class methods that implement the Stein algorithm
(binary Euclidean algorithm) for calculating the GCD of two, three, etc. integers
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_GCD_algorithm,
https://habrahabr.ru/post/205106/). Methods should also determine the value.
the time required to perform the calculations. Develop unit tests for
testing methods of this type.
2. Implement an extension method to get a string binary
double precision real-time representations in IEEE 754 format
(it is advisable not to use ready-made converter classes). To develop
unit tests.
